Max Bid
This item supports Max Bidding! 
The bid you enter will automatically be a Max Bid. 
If your Max Bid is higher than the next Bid Increment, 
the bid will only be raised to the next Bid Increment. 
If someone else bids on this item for an amount less than your Max Bid, 
then you will automatically beat them 
and your bid will be increased to the Bid Increment necessary to beat them 
(or increased to your Max Bid itself, if that's lower).

Bid Increment
To keep bidding competitive and interesting, 
you are required to increase the bid by an amount comparable to the current bid itself. 
Here's the guide:

Current Bid Amount						Bid Increment
250 or less								25
250 - 500								50
500 - 1000								100
1000 - 5000								250
5000 - 10000							500
10000 - 25000							1000
25000 - 50000							2500
50000 - 10000000						5000
